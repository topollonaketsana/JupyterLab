## JupyterLab
This is an interactive computing environment that allows you to work with document and code in a flexible and intuitive way. Its like a digital notebook, I don't see much difference between JupyterLab and Jupyter notebook, hence, JupyterLab is a latest version. We can use it to run programs, visualise data and analyse results - all within your web browser, you do not have to download it. This tool supports multiple programming languages and provides tools for editing, debug and sharing your work. 

## Why JupyterLab

- Flexible
- Interactive
- Multi-language Support
- Education and learning

  ```bash

- You should see the version number of the installed python
